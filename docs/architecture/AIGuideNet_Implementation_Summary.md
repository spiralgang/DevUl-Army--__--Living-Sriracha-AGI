# AIGuideNet Implementation Summary

## Problem Addressed

The problem statement highlighted the critical issue of AI systems suffering from "flailing" behavior - where robust infrastructure exists but the AI's core reasoning and action selection lack proper guidance, memory, or planning. This leads to:

- Random tool selection without understanding capabilities
- No persistent memory between interactions
- Reactive responses without strategic planning
- Repeated mistakes without learning
- Ineffective resource utilization

## Solution: Autonomous Internal Guidance & Routing Network (AIGuideNet)

AIGuideNet transforms the AI from a simple reactive inference engine into an intelligent, proactive planning and execution system.
