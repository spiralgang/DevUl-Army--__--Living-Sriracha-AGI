# AIGuideNet - Autonomous Internal Guidance & Routing Network

## Overview

AIGuideNet is a comprehensive framework implemented in DevUtilityV2.5 that addresses the "flailing" problem in AI systems by providing structured internal guidance, memory, and routing mechanisms. This framework transforms the AI from a simple reactive inference engine into an intelligent, proactive planning and execution system.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. TaskStateManager (`ai/core/TaskStateManager.kt`)
**Role**: Short-Term Context Memory and Task Orchestration

- **Hierarchical Task Management**: Manages tasks, subtasks, and their dependencies
- **State Tracking**: Tracks task status (pending, in-progress, completed, failed, blocked)
- **Execution Monitoring**: Records tool usage, execution times, and outputs
- **Priority Management**: Handles task prioritization and scheduling

**Key Features**:
- Task decomposition into subtasks
- Dependency management between tasks
- Tool execution tracking and metrics
- Task cleanup and history management

#### 2. AIGuidanceSystem (`ai/core/AIGuidanceSystem.kt`)
**Role**: Persistent Memory & Policy Engine

- **Knowledge Base**: Stores workflows, best practices, and learned patterns
- **Policy Engine**: Enforces rules and constraints for task execution
- **User Preferences**: Learns and stores personalized user preferences
- **Workflow Patterns**: Records successful execution patterns for reuse

**Key Features**:
- Knowledge categorization and querying
- Policy-based constraint enforcement
- User preference learning and adaptation
- Workflow pattern recognition and recording

#### 3. AIThinkModule (Enhanced) (`ai/AIThinkModule.kt`)
**Role**: Executive Planner

Enhanced from basic thinking to comprehensive planning:

- **Goal Parser & Decomposer**: Breaks down user prompts into structured sub-goals
- **Action Selector & Router**: Maps tasks to appropriate tools and functions
- **Plan Validation**: Validates plans against policies and system constraints
- **Execution Orchestration**: Coordinates tool execution and monitors progress

**Key Features**:
- Structured planning loop (parse → decompose → validate → execute → reflect)
- Tool orchestration with intelligent selection
- Plan validation against policies and constraints
- Reflection and learning from execution results

#### 4. AIEnvironmentAwareness (Enhanced) (`ai/AIEnvironmentAwareness.kt`)
**Role**: Dynamic Context Mapper

Enhanced with tool capability registry and system monitoring:

- **Tool Capability Registry**: Catalogs available tools with their specifications
- **System State Monitor**: Tracks resource utilization and system health
- **Dependency Mapper**: Understands library versions and configurations
- **Tool Recommendation**: Suggests optimal tools for specific tasks

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive tool registration and capability tracking
- Real-time system resource monitoring
- Intelligent tool selection based on context and resources
- Dependency analysis and feature mapping

#### 5. AIGuideNetCoordinator (`ai/core/AIGuideNetCoordinator.kt`)
**Role**: Central Integration Hub

Orchestrates all AIGuideNet components to provide unified functionality:

- **System Initialization**: Coordinates component startup and readiness
- **Request Processing**: Provides unified API for intelligent task execution
- **Health Monitoring**: Tracks system health and component status
- **Learning Coordination**: Manages cross-component learning and adaptation

## Problem Solved: The "Flailing" Issue

### Before AIGuideNet (The Problem)
Traditional AI systems suffer from "flailing" behavior:
- **Blind Inference**: Every action is inferred without context or memory
- **No Planning Structure**: Reactive responses without strategic thinking
- **Tool Misuse**: Random tool selection without understanding capabilities
- **No Learning**: Repeated mistakes without improvement
- **Context Loss**: No persistent memory between interactions

### After AIGuideNet (The Solution)
Structured, intelligent AI behavior:
- **Proactive Planning**: Strategic decomposition of complex tasks
- **Contextual Memory**: Persistent knowledge and learned patterns
- **Intelligent Tool Orchestration**: Optimal tool selection based on capabilities
- **Self-Correction**: Learning from outcomes to improve future performance
- **Structured Communication**: Coordinated information sharing between components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Task Execution
```kotlin
// Initialize AIGuideNet
val coordinator = AIGuideNetCoordinator(
    taskStateManager, aiGuidanceSystem, 
    aiEnvironmentAwareness, aiThinkModule
)
coordinator.initialize()

// Execute a request with intelligent planning
val request = AIGuideNetCoordinator.ExecutionRequest(
    userPrompt = "Compress and upload my project files to cloud storage",
    context = mapOf("project_path" to "/path/to/project"),
    userId = "user123"
)

val response = coordinator.executeRequest(request)
```

### Tool Registration
```kotlin
// Register a new tool with full capability specification
aiEnvironmentAwareness.registerTool(ToolCapability(
    toolName = "AdvancedCompressor",
    description = "High-efficiency compression with multiple algorithms",
    category = ToolCategory.COMPRESSION,
    inputRequirements = mapOf(
        "source_file" to ParameterSpec("source_file", "String", true, "File to compress"),
        "algorithm" to ParameterSpec("algorithm", "String", false, "Compression method", "lz4")
    ),
    expectedOutputs = listOf(
        OutputSpec("compressed_file", "String", "Path to compressed output"),
        OutputSpec("compression_ratio", "Float", "Achieved compression ratio")
    ),
    estimatedExecutionTime = 2000L,
    resourceRequirements = ResourceRequirements(memoryMB = 64, cpuIntensive = true),
    reliability = 0.95f
))
```

### Knowledge Learning
```kotlin
// Add workflow knowledge
aiGuidanceSystem.addKnowledge(
    category = KnowledgeCategory.WORKFLOW_PATTERNS,
    topic = "Efficient File Processing",
    content = "For large files: validate → compress → process → upload → verify",
    confidence = 0.9f
)

// Learn user preferences
aiGuidanceSystem.learnUserPreference(
    userId = "user123",
    category = PreferenceCategory.TOOL_PREFERENCES,
    key = "compression_algorithm",
    value = "gzip",
    confidence = 0.8f,
    learnedFrom = "successful_execution"
)
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Dependency Injection
AIGuideNet components are designed to work with the existing Hilt dependency injection:

```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
object AIGuideNetModule {
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideTaskStateManager(): TaskStateManager = TaskStateManager()
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideAIGuidanceSystem(): AIGuidanceSystem = AIGuidanceSystem()
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideAIGuideNetCoordinator(
        taskStateManager: TaskStateManager,
        aiGuidanceSystem: AIGuidanceSystem,
        aiEnvironmentAwareness: AIEnvironmentAwareness,
        aiThinkModule: AIThinkModule
    ): AIGuideNetCoordinator = AIGuideNetCoordinator(
        taskStateManager, aiGuidanceSystem, 
        aiEnvironmentAwareness, aiThinkModule
    )
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
Enhanced components maintain backward compatibility:
- **AIThinkModule**: Legacy `think()` and `learn()` methods preserved
- **AIEnvironmentAwareness**: Existing context methods enhanced but preserved
- **Gradual Migration**: Existing code continues to work while gaining AIGuideNet benefits
