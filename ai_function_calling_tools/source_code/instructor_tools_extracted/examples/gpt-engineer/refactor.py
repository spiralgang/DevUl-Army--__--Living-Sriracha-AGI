     1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    -2. Start the app by running `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
    +2. Start the app by running `flask run`.
     3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/docs` to access the Swagger UI documentation.

     ## Example

     To perform a basic math operation, you can use the following curl command:

     ```bash
    -curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"operation": "add", "operands": [2, 3]}' http://localhost:8000/calculate
