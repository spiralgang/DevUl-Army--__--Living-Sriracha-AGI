The app should allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, and all changes should be reflected in local storage for persistence across sessions.\n\n## Requirements\n- Users can add new tasks\n- Users can edit existing tasks  \n- Users can delete tasks\n- Users can mark tasks as completed/incomplete\n- Tasks are saved in local storage and restored on page reload\n\n## Technical Specifications\n- Frontend only (no backend required)\n- Use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks)\n- Code should be compatible with Android 10 browser (ES6 minimum, avoid newer APIs)\n- UI should be responsive and simple\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All functionality must work without requiring any network connection\n- All task changes persist after reload (verify via local storage)\n- Clean, commented code and minimal UI",
