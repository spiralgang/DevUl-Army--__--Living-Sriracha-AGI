Based on the provided information, the user is experiencing a failing GitHub Actions job in a pull request (PR) and needs a solution. The root cause is that the git diff command is failing because the main branch doesn't exist locally on the runner, leading to an "unknown revision" error. This is a common issue in GitHub Actions workflows.

🛠️ The Fix for PR #58

To resolve the failing job in PR #58, you need to add a step to the GitHub Actions workflow to fetch the main branch before the git diff command runs. You also need to correct the git diff syntax to explicitly compare the PR's HEAD with origin/main.

The Problem

The workflow step uses git diff --name-only origin/main..., but the GitHub Actions runner, by default, only checks out the specific branch or commit associated with the pull request. It doesn't have the origin/main branch available locally, which is required for the comparison. This results in a fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/main...': unknown revision or path not in the working tree error.

The Solution

You must modify the .github/workflows/pr-gate.yml file with the following steps.

Fetch the main branch: Add a git fetch command before the git diff step. This makes the origin/main branch available to the runner.

YAML

- name: Fetch main branch run: git fetch origin main 

Correct the git diff syntax: Explicitly specify HEAD to compare the changes in the current branch against origin/main.

Bash

git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD 

Putting It All Together

Here's an example of how the corrected workflow file should look:

The log output indicates an error: fatal: unknown revision or path not in the working tree, caused by a git diff command attempting to reference origin/main without fetching it first. The request provides a complete solution to modify the .github/workflows/pr-gate.yml file. NORMALIZED TERMS: None required. ACTION PLAN: Implement the user-provided, production-grade fix by adding a git fetch step and correcting the git diff syntax in the specified workflow file to resolve the job failure.

You're right, the shallow clone used by default in GitHub Actions runners is the root of the problem. Here is the production-grade fix, structured from your analysis, to resolve the failing job in PR #58.

Root Cause Analysis

The CI job fails because the actions/checkout action performs a shallow clone of the pull request branch by default. This means the runner's local repository clone does not have knowledge of other branches, including main. Consequently, the command git diff --name-only origin/main... fails because the reference origin/main is an unknown revision in the runner's working tree.

Corrective Actions

To resolve this, we will modify the .github/workflows/pr-gate.yml workflow file to ensure the main branch is available for comparison.

Fetch the Main Branch: Before running the diff command, we must explicitly fetch the main branch from the origin remote. This makes the origin/main reference available locally on the runner.

Correct the Diff Syntax: The existing diff command is slightly ambiguous. We will change it to git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD to create an explicit comparison between the tip of the main branch and the HEAD of the current PR branch.

Implementation

Here is the updated step for the pr-gate.yml workflow:

YAML

# .github/workflows/pr-gate.yml # (Previous steps in the job remain the same) - name: Fetch main branch for diff run: git fetch origin main shell: bash - name: Check PR file scope run: | # Compare files changed in this PR against the main branch. # The grep command ensures changes are limited to approved directories. if ! git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -Eq '^(\.github/|scripts/|configs/|ai/|app/src/)'; then echo "::error::PR touches out-of-scope files. Changes are only allowed in .github/, scripts/, configs/, ai/, or app/src/." exit 1 fi shell: bash # (Subsequent steps in the job remain the same) 

By implementing these two changes, the scope-check logic will function correctly, resolving the job failure and properly enforcing repository contribution policies.
