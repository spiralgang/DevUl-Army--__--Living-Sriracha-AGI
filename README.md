# *Application Utility Useage Descriptor:*
 *Our "DevUtilityAndroidV2" program has been designed as a downloadable, self-contained Android application. This app integrates an AI-driven coding interface with multi-window and split-screen support, front-end customization, and manual code editing capabilities, all accessible through the appâ€™s interface, and has been specifically-tailored for Samsung's Galaxy s9+ running Android 10+ (Target Device & SDK-Level)*

# Third-Party Collaborator Credits: 

xAI 

Anthropic
 
 *Our app's executable code run script was forumlated through collaboration with xAI's "Grok 3", with quality control/errors double-checking from Anthropic's "Claude 3.7", which was then brought back to Grok for entirety error/quality reworkings.*

 # Notable Commentary 
 For years we've tirelessly trial-run-tested dozens, if not hundreds of mobile-friendly, code-creation & output-launch product options of both AI companies, normative file programs & browser-based-software websites with intentions of manifesting our intellectual visions.
 
Among the many resources we tried being the established well-known goto "it" sources for various/all developer needs, with some even openly marketting (fraudulently) "code anything professionally" products type-promises, with zero having the conceptual requirements feasibility for bringing any of our visions to life (like Replit, Code Studio, Google-Cloud, Microsoft, Android-Studio, Github's Copilot, Termux, UserLAnd, Al-Sultan Shell, even Apple iOS' Shortcuts..to name just a few)...

As such-confidently we convey, that without the two mentioned industry-best collaborators, and their free-useage-tiers product metrics, this project's feasibility would have never been possible for us. We especially thank both of their respective teams. *-Make sure to check their products out!*
