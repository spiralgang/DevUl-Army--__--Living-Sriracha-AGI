 # Notable Commentary 
 For years we've tirelessly trial-run-tested dozens, if not hundreds, of mobile-friendly app creation options of both AI & normative program apps & browser websites. 
 
Many of them the goto sources for all developer needs, with some openly marketting with "code anything professionally" products type-promises (like Replit, Code Studio, Google-Cloud, Microsoft, Android-Studio, Github's Copilot, even Apple iOS' Shortcuts..to name just a few). 

As such-confidently we convey, that without the mentioned industry-best collaborators, and their free-useage-tiers product metrics, this project's feasibility would have never been possible for us. We specially thank both of their respective teams. *-Make sure to check their products out!*
