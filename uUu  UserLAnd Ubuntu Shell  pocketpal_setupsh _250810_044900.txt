      Your build configuration is incomplete and previously worked by accident!
      setuptools-scm requires setuptools>=61

      Suggested workaround if applicable:
       - migrating from the deprecated setup_requires mechanism to pep517/518
         and using a pyproject.toml to declare build dependencies
         which are reliably pre-installed before running the build tools
